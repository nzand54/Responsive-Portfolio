                        I have always had an appetite for technology; after excitedly figuring out how to use a script to automate a repetitive task in excel, I knew that learning how to code was the next step in my career. I have had the opportunity to work across several top-tier finance and technology companies and am currently in a finance rotational program with Comcast NBCUniversal. Between the Drexel Co-op program (6 month internships) and my current position, I have learned how to quickly add value, be adaptable and pinpoint opportunities to improve process efficiency. 

                        <br></br>
                        I am currently seeking a front-end web developer position, specializing in JavaScript and React. I look forward to applying my web development skills to my current foundations in business.</p>
